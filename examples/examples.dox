@section create üî® Creating Dynarr
In this section we'll discuss creation of the dynamic array. @n

Based on @ref create.c "Example file".


@subsection def_create ‚öôÔ∏è With default options
           A standard way to create @c dynarr_t is to call a macro wrapper
           @ref dynarr_create, it passes default option values, so you
           dont have to provide them yourself.

@dontinclude create.c
@skip main
@skip default_create
@skipline dynarr_t
@arg @ref dynarr_opts_t::element_size "element_size" is the only mandatory explicit option.
@arg Full list of default options: @ref DYNARR_DEFAULT_ARGS
@n

@subsection custom_opts ‚öôÔ∏è With custom options

@skip explicit_opts_create
@skip  dynarr_t
@until );
@n

@subsection wthout_macro_wrapper ‚öôÔ∏è Without macro wrapper
            You can avoid macro wrapper with default values
            if you know what you are doing. @n

Just create @ref dynarr_opts_t "opts" on stack
and pass by reference into a @ref dynarr_create_ function directly:
@dontinclude create.c
@skip cloning
@skipline opts
@skipline dynarr_t
@n

@subsection extended_header ‚öôÔ∏è Allocate extended header
            This is important for derived classes that need to include their data @n
            in a memory allocated by underlying @ref src/vector.h "vector".

Define a structure @p ext_t that will be peallocated right after @ref dynarr_header_t :
@dontinclude create.c
@skip extended_header
@skip typedef
@until _t;

Create dynarr specifying @ref dynarr_opts_t::ext_header_size to reserve space for @p ext_t.
@skip dynarr_t
@until );

Initialize extended header:
@skip dynarr_get_ext_header
@until {0};
@n

@subsection cloning ‚øª Clone an existing array
With @ref dynarr_clone you are able to produce exact copy of an existing array.

@skip cloning
@skipline dynarr_clone
@n

@subsection handle_alloc_error ‚ùå Error handling
            Default implementation uses heap as allocation memory source.
            Depending on system architecture heap allocation is not fail proof,
            take it into your considerations.

Check that @p dynarr value is @c NULL, then resolve allocation error.
If you got none resolution choises, perform gracefull program termination.
See following example, print error and exit abnormally.

@dontinclude create.c
@skip default_create
@skip !dynarr
@until }

@n

Other option is to just use an @c assert.
If allocation error is unlikely to happen, but you still need to indicate if it occures.

@skip explicit_opts_create
@skipline assert

Advantage of asserts if that they can be disabled by providing @c -DNDEBUG compilation flag.

@n

@subsection deallocate üß® Deallocating Dynarr
Prevent memory leaks by deallocation resources, when they not needed anymore!
@n

@dontinclude create.c
@skipline dynarr_destroy

@attention Always remember to deallocate @p dynarr created with
@ref dynarr_create or @ref dynarr_clone !
